              The world is glorious and weird. Wouldn't it be grand to explore
              and take it all in?

              It's just a bit more gratifying to get likes on social media, you
              know? Especially with an app like Clout Chaser!!! The ultimate app
              for measuring your self-worth.

            This was an entry for
            <a href="https://koia.nz/">Koia Game Jam 2022</a>, a game jam
            focused on toxic cyber culture and the spreading of misinformation.

            The game explores the theme of screen addiction, through the
            mechanic of a game within a game. The main goal is to navigate
            through the path to meet your friend. Avoiding the obstacles is
            relatively simple. After a while however, anxious thoughts begin to
            set in. The player has to distract themselves by collecting likes in
            a mobile game called Clout Chaser. The challenge is to keep avoiding
            the obstacles while keeping the character's mind at ease.

            I wanted the sound design to emphasise the player's restless mind.
            As the player becomes increasingly desparate to check their phone,
            chaotic and creepy sound begins to fade in. This is contrasted
            against bright, sugary music once the player picks up their phone.
            The sound design of the phone game is inspired by games like Candy
            Crush, designed to hook players and maximise dopamine release.
