            This is a mobile game prototype I've been working on which takes
            attempts to gamify the mundane activity of feeding ducks. The player
            aims using the phone's gyroscope, and throws food by swiping up. The
            challenge lies in attempting to feed as many of the ducks as
            possible, with only a limited amount of food to go around.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fed ducks reward the player with "Duck Bux", a currency which
            further in development will be used to purchase more ducks, access
            to new ponds, and decorations which can be placed in and around the
            pond.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game takes place in real-time. After feeding their ducks, the
            player has to wait a few hours until they are ready to be fed again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ducks are each unique, each with different breeds, names,
            genders, and stats. Some ducks are faster than others, some are more
            aware of their surroundings.
