            This is a mobile game prototype I've been working on which attempts
            to gamify the mundane activity of feeding ducks. The challenge lies
            in attempting to feed as many of the ducks as possible, with only a
            limited amount of food to go around.
          </p>
          <p>
            To throw duck food, the player swipes up from the bottom of the
            screen. The direction and force of the throw is determined by the
            direction and speed of their swipe. The player can also look around
            the pond by dragging across the screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ducks' AI was implemented with the help of the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm"
              >A* pathfinding algorithm</a
            >. Ducks will wander aimlessly around the lake until they detect
            that food has landed nearby, after which they all race towards it
            while cleverly avoiding any obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fed ducks reward the player with "Duck Bux", a currency which
            further in development will be used to purchase more ducks, access
            to new ponds, and decorations which can be placed in and around the
            pond.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game takes place in real-time. After feeding their ducks, the
            player has to wait a few hours until they are ready to be fed again.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ducks are each unique, each with different breeds, names,
            genders, and stats. Some ducks are faster than others, some are more
            aware of their surroundings.
          </p>
