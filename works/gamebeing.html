            GameBeing is an audiovisual experience in which material physicality
            and spatial expression are being combined through the lens of
            digital play.
          </p>
          <p>
            Central to the work is a Nintendo GameBoy Advance; which not only
            represents a traditional interface for technology-centred play, but
            acts as one of the driving forces which generates the audio and
            disrupts the visuals in response. Motion is sensed from the audience
            via a webcam which uses movement to generate visuals through an
            algorithm built in TouchDesigner. The same movement captured by the
            webcam also manipulates the sound in direct response to the motion
            of each audience member.
          </p>
          <p>
            GameBeing seeks to create a hybrid of procedurally-generated story
            and play with motion-controlled physical and spatial expression from
            an audience, developing an audiovisual narrative encapsulating both
            material technology and physical movement within a space –
            transcending the limits of play typically imposed by the use of
            traditional video game equipment.

            GameBeing is a collaboration between myself and my friend Sabrina of
            Knifedge Visuals. We wanted to create an audiovisual experience
            which reacts to user motion, using this data to alter the sound and
            visuals. My main focus was on writing the music whilst Sabrina's was
            on designing and programming the visuals.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wrote a handful of tracks which react to motion controls in
            various ways. In some tracks the user is able to control the volume
            of different parts by raising their hands. In others, the position
            of their hands is used to control the pitch of a part, allowing them
            to improvise using their body.
