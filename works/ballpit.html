                <p>Ball Pit is an interactive audiovisual experience, exploring 3D sound and the correlation of pitch and colour.</p>
                <p>The user is centered within a dark square room, and given the ability to create balls which, upon colliding with either the wall or another ball, will produce a tone and emit a coloured light. The user is able to select the pitch of each ball, which also affects its colour and it's size. Additionally, the user is able to select from a range of different timbres. By adding different combinations of balls to the simulation, the user is able to create a limitless number of unique generative soundscapes.</p>
                <p>Ball Pit is currently playable on Windows, Android and online. The Windows and Android versions feature HRTF spatialization which realistically simulates how each collision would sound based on its position relative to the user. The Android version also has AR integration, allowing the user to look around the virtual room by physically moving their phone.</p>
                <p>Ball Pit was developed using Unity, FMOD, and <a href ="https://valvesoftware.github.io/steam-audio/">Steam Audio.</a></p>
