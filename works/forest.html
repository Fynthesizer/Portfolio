              Forest is an interactive audio-visual experience, inspired by the
              natural phenomenon of plant communication. Plants talk to each
              other via an underground network of mycelium. I wanted to explore
              how this could be sonically represented - as though you were
              listening in on their conversations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user interacts by clicking on the ground, causing a tree to
              sprout from the chosen spot. Each tree is uniquely generated, and
              the user is able to watch as it gradually takes form.
            </p>
            <p>
              The trees periodically exchange signals with each other, which is
              sonified as an arpeggio, moving up from the root of the tree to
              its leaves. The unique shape of each tree also affects the way it
              sounds, with the length of each branch determining the pitch
              emitted. As more trees are planted, the soundscape becomes more
              lively and full.
            </p>
            <p>
              The work explores proximity and the value of community. Like
              trees, we depend on one another, and thrive as part of a deeply
              interconnected network. We communicate and collaborate to create a
              whole which is greater than the sum of its parts.

            This was my first attempt at making something using
            <a href="https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>. I also made use of
            <a href="https://tonejs.github.io/">Tone.js</a> for audio synthesis.
            Currently it works on Android, PC, and Mac, but only on certain
            browsers, including Chrome and Edge.

            Click on the ground to plant some trees, and enjoy the music. ðŸŽ¶
