          <p>
            Recently I've been fascinated with procedurally generated worlds. I
            wanted to try creating something similar to
            <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us">Minecraft</a>, in which
            the player is placed in an infinite, procedurally generated
            environment that they are able to sculpt how they wish.

          <h3>World Generation</h3>
          <p>
            The program was made in Unity. When a new world is created, the
            initial terrain data is generated using perlin noise. From this
            data, it then generates the 3D mesh using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes"
              >Marching Cubes</a
            >
            algorithm. Additionally, materials are assigned to each voxel using
            various rules - e.g. the topmost voxels are usually assigned grass,
            then below that is dirt, and even further below is stone. The
            material data is used to set the colour of each vertex.
          </p>

          <p>
            After generating the terrain, natural features such as trees, rocks,
            grass, etc. are then dispersed. Another perlin noise map is used to
            determine the "fertility" of the soil. More fertile areas are more
            likely to spawn plants.
          </p>
          <p>
            The world is procedurally generated as the player explores. The
            program regularly checks the player's location, and decides which
            chunks need to be loaded in. This means that each world is
            effectively infinite.

          <h3>Weather and Time</h3>
          <p>
            The game features a day-night cycle, and dynamically changing
            weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            Perlin noise is once again used to determine the strength and
            direction of wind, cloudiness, and whether or not it is raining at
            any given time.
          </p>
          <h3>Dynamic Audio</h3>
          <p>
            Sound effects were programmed using FMOD. I wanted to use audio in
            this project to create the impression of a living, tangible world.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way that I set out to achieve this, is through dynamic reverb.
            The game will automatically detect when the player is in a cave by
            checking how enclosed they are from the outside. When the player is
            determined to be in a cave, reverb is applied to most sound effects,
            and the volume of outdoor ambience (birds, rain, crickets, etc.) is
            lowered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weather and time also affects the ambient sound. As night comes
            around, the sound of birdsong is slowly replaced with crickets
            chirping. When the wind is blowing strongly enough, you can hear it.
