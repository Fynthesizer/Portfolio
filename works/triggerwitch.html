                    <p>Magic and firearms make a deadly combo in this blood-splattered take on classic top-down adventure!</p>

                    <p>Recalling the visual style and intuitive gameplay of 16-bit action-adventure classics, Trigger Witch puts an ultra-violent spin on cute and colorful pixel art. With a compelling and original narrative, puzzling environments to explore, a dynamic soundtrack, twin-stick shooter mechanics and a vast array of enemies to blast into smithereens, this is a tale that will grip you from start to bloody finish.</p>

                    <p>From the creators of Reverie, Trigger Witch is a stylized 2D twin-stick action game set in an odd open world where magic is outdated and firearms are the new way of life. Players assume the role of Colette, a prospective graduate from the Stock, an academy for Witchcraft and Triggery. After a mysterious man invades her realm, events are set in motion that turn Coletteâ€™s life upside-down, casting her as the sole heroine with enough firepower to restore peace.</p>

                <p>The soundtrack to Trigger Witch is reactive to the gameplay. Most of the tracks I composed for Trigger Witch have two versions: a 'light' version, composed with Super Nintendo RPG inspired instrumentation; and a 'heavy' version, which is a synth-metal arrangement of the light version. The light version plays while the player is exploring an area. When the player runs into enemies, however, the music crossfades into the heavy track.</p>
                <p>Writing the music for Trigger Witch was an intense but fun challenge - trying to write music which would work in two contrasting styles, while maintaining the same melody, harmony, and BPM.</p>
