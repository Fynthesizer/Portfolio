                Glib Globson was but a humble intergalactic courier operating under the Blingblong Empire. Until one fateful space-day, Glib's ship picked up a strange signal coming from a seemingly uninhabited planet in the nearby Flimflam System. As Glib flies in to investigate, suddenly the ship's nano-quantum-sci-fi-prefix capacitors begin to malfunction, causing it to plummet towards the mysterious planet's surface.

                <p>
                Glib awakens in a disoriented daze, having miraculously survived the crash. Beginning to come to, Glib finds themselves in a dense jungle populated by bizarre alien lifeforms. With no available means of communication, Glib sets out on exploring this strange land, in the hopes of finding civilisation.

                The Otherworldly Adventures of Glib Globson is an experiment in the concept of musical storytelling – using abstract musical elements to represent narrative and to convey mood and atmosphere. Each track is respresentative of a "chapter" in the overall narrative of Glib Globson's adventures.

                <p>Inspired by the idea of creative limitation, a rule which I set for myself for this project was to use only sounds which I could record myself. I stuck only to the instruments which I have at my disposal, steering clear of software synthesizers and samples. The album also makes heavy use of field recordings, which I gathered from various locations around Wellington.</p>
                <p>The album blends elements of electronic music and psychedelic rock.</p>
