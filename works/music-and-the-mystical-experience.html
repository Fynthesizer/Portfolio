              Music & the Mystical Experience is 6 hours and 9 minutes of
              carefully designed music for psychedelic therapy (in particular
              psilocybin).
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was recorded for Michael Sutherland's postgraduate
              studies at Massey University, in New Zealand with 27 musicians at
              Massey's Flagship recording studio.
            </p>
            <p>
              Based on years of research into the neuroscience of music,
              psychedelics, and of course recording/engineering. We are at the
              release and promotion phase and are about to begin filming a
              documentary!
            </p>
            <p>
              This project was recorded over 3 incredible sessions, involving
              research-based prompts, and elaborately guided improvisations [via
              projection visuals and prompt cards]. These sessions also involved
              ritual, reverence, and respect for the purpose of our
              music-making, alongside researched-based elements to maximize
              flow-state, improvisation, and musical cohesion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was followed by a year of editing, mixing, and sound design
              by Michael Sutherland to get the project ready for release to the
              public and use in centers around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Essentially we've taken years of research, 27 musicians, and the
              best recording environment possible and forged it into the largest
              psychedelic music project in the world!
            </p>

            I partook in all three improvisational sessions for this project,
            playing piano, rhodes, organ and synthesizer.
