            This was an entry for
            <a href="https://itch.io/jam/regenerate-game-jam-matariki"
              >Regenerate Game Jam - Matariki 2022</a
            >, a game jam focused on sustainable and regenerative farming
            practices. We had the opportunity to learn from experts about MƒÅori
            tradition and food production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The aim of the game is to gather a variety of medicinal plants. The
            player is encouraged to forage in a sustainable manner, as
            over-harvesting from one plant will cause it to die, potentially
            making the goal unattainable. Over time, plants will regenerate,
            meaning that you can come back later to complete your checklist.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the music, I attempted to make something which combined
            traditional MƒÅori instrumental music with the kind of music you
            might hear in a game like Stardew Valley, to creating a relaxing,
            spiritual vibe. The music is accompanied by the ambient sounds of
            New Zealand wildlife.
          </p>
          <p>
            As well as working on music and sound design, I also integrated the
            audio using FMOD. I set up a dynamic system which modulates the
            music and ambience over the course of the game's day-night cycle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tragically, the music and ambience broke just as we were building
            the final submission, which no doubt is why we didn't win in the
            audio category. On the bright side however, I received the award for
            Outstanding Particpant. üòé
